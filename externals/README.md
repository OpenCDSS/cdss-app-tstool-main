# externals #

These files were originally in a Subversion repository that was included by reference as an "external".
When the repositories were transferred to Git via Eclipse projects it was easier to copy the files into a folder.

* `CDSS/` - files that support creating CDSS installer, etc., probably can be moved to other folders
* `NativeJ/` - probably can be removed

#
# Name - database identifier for use in applications, for example as the
#     input type/name information for time series identifiers (usually a short string)
# Description - database description for reports and user interfaces (a sentence)
#
# The following are needed to make the low-level data connection:
#
# DatabaseEngine - the database software (Oracle is default)
# DatabaseServer - IP or string address for database server
# DatabaseName - database name used by the server
# SystemLogin - service account login
# SystemPassword - service account password

# How TSTool should create TSIDs
# CommonName - old style that used common name for identifiers - prone to issues because of non-unique values in HDB
#              and special characters including periods and dashes in strings
# SDI_MRI - new style that relies on SDI and MRI integer values (default if property is not specified)
TSIDStyle = SDI_MRI
# The WRITE_TO_HDB stored procedure should allow an end date to be offset from the start date by NHour.
# However, it appears to always offset by 1Hour.  Therefore the end date cannot be relied upon for the TSTool date/time when reading
# Use the following property to adjust the handling of the end date
# ReadNHourEndDateTime = EndDateTime  (use this if WRITE_TO_HDB does write the end date offset as expected, default)
# ReadNHourEndDateTime = StartDateTimePlusInterval  (use this to compensate for WRITE_TO_HDB not writing the end_date_time with offset)
ReadNHourEndDateTime = StartDateTimePlusInterval
# The following properties control the timeone for the initial datastore connection
# and for each stored procedure read, in seconds.

# Configuration information for "ReclamationHDB" data store (connection)
# Properties are:
#
# The user will see the following when interacting with the data store:
#
# Name - database identifier for use in applications, for example as the
#     input type/name information for time series identifiers (usually a short string)
# Description - database description for reports and user interfaces (a sentence)
#
# The following are needed to make the low-level data connection:
#
# DatabaseEngine - the database software (Oracle is default)
# DatabaseServer - IP or string address for database server
# DatabaseName - database name used by the server
# SystemLogin - service account login
# SystemPassword - service account password

Enabled = True
Type = "ReclamationHDBDataStore"
Name = "ReclamationHDB-Dev"
# SQL to query the database priodically so that connection does not drop (similar to SQuirreL)
KeepAliveSQL = "SELECT * from HDB_STATE"
KeepAliveFrequency = "120"
Description = "Reclamation HDB Development database"
# As per Andrew Gilmore, the following is echdbdev.bor.doi.net
DatabaseServer = "140.219.130.200"
DatabaseName = "echdbdev"

# How TSTool should create TSIDs
# CommonName - old style that used common name for identifiers - prone to issues because of non-unique values in HDB
# SDI_MRI - new style that relies on SDI and MRI integer values (default if property is not specified)
TSIDStyle = SDI_MRI

# plugins #

This folder contains plugin datastores that are provided in the TSTool install folder.
Because such files are dynamic, all files are ignored in the repository.
However, during development, files could be copied to this folder.

The similar `plugins` software install folder will typically be filled, for example, when installing TSTool
in Linux, by copying relevant plugin files into the folder.

Plugins can also be installed in user's `.tstool/N/plugins` folder.

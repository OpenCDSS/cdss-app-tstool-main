# doc #

This folder contains documentation files used in the testing environment,
mainly to access from ***Help*** menu.
Similar files used for deployment release are located in "resources/runtime/doc".

**Because documentation is now online, these files will be removed in the future.**

* `Training/` - training materials
* `UserManual/` - user manual

# test/operational #

This folder contains test configuration for TSTool development environment.
This allows TSTool to be run from Eclipse as if in a production (operational) environment,
without having to do a full build and install.

See the Eclipse ***Run / Run Configurations*** such as `TSTool_CDSS`,
which specifies `-home test/operational/CDSS` to run TSTool from Eclipse.

These files should not be confused with functional tests that are in the
`cdss-app-tstool-test` repository, although those tests can be run
from TSTool that is started from Eclipse.

Contents of this folder include:

* `CDSS/` - configuration files for Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS),
which is the default install environment for TSTool
	+ **these are important for developers and mimic production systems**
	+ it may be necessary in the future to support specific developers
	so might need to .gitignore some files and provide examples that developers
	use to configure their environment
* `data/` - data to support automated tests, legacy and may be removed since tests
are in a separate repository
* `results/` - results from automated tests, legacy and may be removed since tests
are in a separate repository
* `src/` - code that is auto-generated for tests, legacy and may be removed since tests
are in a separate repository (previously generated by Abbot? which is not currently used)

# installer/CDSS #

These files are used to create the TSTool NSIS Windows installer:

* `License.txt` - license language used to create NSIS installer, latest GPL v3 version.
See also the `/resources/notices` folder for a similar notice that was inserted into code files.
* `License-legacy.txt` - old license language, no longer used but kept for archive purposes
(can delete when fully transitioned to OpenCDSS approach)
* `TSTool.nsi` - high level configuration variables for TSTool used by NSIS

For the Eclipse plug-in, we suggest using the update site:

    * Select Help / Software updates / Find and Install.
    * Search for new features to install.
    * New remote site.
    * Enter http://beust.com/eclipse in the URL and whatever description you want.
    * Make sure the check box next to http://beust.com/eclipse is checked and click Next.
    * Eclipse will then guide you through the process.

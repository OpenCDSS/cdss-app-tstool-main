**This `README-dev.md` file is not intended to be distributed with the installer.**

TSTool documentation is now installed on the web and is not distributed with the software.
The legacy `doc` folder is retained as a placeholder to help transition to online resources.

* `Training/` - legacy training is retained for historical reasons but will be merged
into documentation or other resources

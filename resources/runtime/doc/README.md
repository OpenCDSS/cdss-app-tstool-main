[TSTool User Documentation is available online](http://opencdss.state.co.us/tstool/latest/doc-user/).

Older versions of TSTool were distributed with PDF documentation.

Use the TSTool ***Help*** menu to access documentation.

Legacy `Training` folder is retained for historical reasons but may be merged into
online documentation or other resources in the future.

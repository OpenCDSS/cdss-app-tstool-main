**This README.md file is NOT intended to be distributed in the TSTool installer.**

This folder contains main configuration files and supporting data for TSTool.
Similar files for the development environment exist in "test/operational/CDSS/system".
The `conf.build.xml` file copies these files to the distribution folder when creating the installer.

* See also the `../system-CDSS` files, which are used with CDSS TSTool distribution.

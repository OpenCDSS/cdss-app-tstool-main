**This `README-dev.md` file is not intended to be distributed with the TSTool installer.
Other `README-dev.md` files are included in folders and should likewise not be distributed in the installer.
Files named `README.md ARE intended for distribution.**

This folder contains resources that are included in the TSTool installer.

* The `conf/build.xml` file copies files to the `dist` folder when processing files for the installer.
* The `bin-CDSS/` and `system-CDSS` folders contain CDSS versions of configuration files,
maintained separately because in the past CDSS and non-CDSS versions of TSTool were distributed,
and this may occur again.

# plugins #

This folder contains TSTool software plugins that are provided in the TSTool install folder.

*   Plugins are typically installed after installing TSTool because they
    often are provided by a third party, for example to integrate with a specific datastore
    that is not part of the built-in functionality.
*   The folder is useful when TSTool is installed in a system that shares software,
    for example, when installing TSTool in Linux, by installing relevant plugin files into the folder.
*   Users can also install plugins in their user files in the `.tstool/N/plugins` folder.

The advantage of installing plugins in the user folder is that the plugins will be found
even if multiple updates to the TSTool software occur.

# bin-CDSS #

**This README.md file is NOT intended to be included in the TSTool installation.**

This folder contains executable software needed in the runtime environment,
for CDSS installation of TSTool.

* `Tstool.bat` - batch file to run TSTool on Windows,
not typically needed because Windows has `TSTool.exe` created by Launch4j
**Need to evaluate if this is used given the version in `bin`.**

**This README.md file is NOT intended to be distributed in the TSTool installer.**

This folder contains configuration files for TSTool for use in
Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS), which is the default target environment.
Similar files for the development environment exist in "test/operational/CDSS/system".
The `conf.build.xml` file copies these files to the distribution folder when creating the installer.

* `CDSS.cfg` - Colorado HydroBase configuration for HydroBase database selector dialog for interactive database selection
* `TSTool.cfg` - main TSTool configuration file
